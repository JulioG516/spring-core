# Spring Core
Spring Core is a Java-based framework for building enterprise-level applications. It provides a wide range of features, including dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, and inversion of control.

# Features
Dependency Injection: Spring Core allows developers to manage the dependencies between objects in an application, making it easier to write maintainable and testable code.

Aspect-Oriented Programming: Spring Core provides support for aspect-oriented programming (AOP), which allows developers to separate cross-cutting concerns (such as logging or security) from the core logic of an application.

Inversion of Control: Spring Core uses the principle of inversion of control (IoC) to manage the creation and configuration of objects in an application. This allows developers to focus on the business logic of an application, rather than on the creation and management of objects.

Container: Spring Core provides a lightweight container that manages the lifecycle of objects in an application, as well as their configuration and dependencies.

# Getting Started
To get started with Spring Core, you'll need to download and install the Spring Framework. Once you have the framework installed, you can start using Spring Core to build your applications.

# Contributing
